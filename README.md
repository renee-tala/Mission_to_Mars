HTML Web Scraping Challenge 

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to scrape data from a NASA website using Jupyter Notebook and Python, and create a site with the scraped data using HTML and Bootstrap.

The first part of this challenege was to scrape High Resolution Mars' Hemisphere Images and Titles. Using the same method for the Mars News Site, I used the browser to visit the site first. Then I created a list to hold the images and titles. I created a for loop to browse through each article, parsed the HTML, scraped and stored my data intot eh list.
