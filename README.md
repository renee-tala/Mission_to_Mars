# Mission to Mars

HTML Web Scraping Challenge 

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to scrape data from a NASA website and create a website of the scraped data.
The four sections of the page are:
1. Mars News
2. Mars Featured Image
3. Mars Facts
4. Mars Hemisphere Images

- Resources:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Python
  - Beautiful Soup
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap

## Summary 

Starting with Jupyter Notebook and Python, I scraped the data from each website, parsed the data using Beautiful Soup, and then found the images and facts I needed. 

I found the featured image and the Hemisphere images using the same method, but used a for loop to get the four Mars images.
